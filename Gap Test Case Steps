Key Points to notice in the automation of test case:
-->In this Project I automated Gap Android mobile app functionality using Appium.
-->Refer to the GapApp Test and GapMethods classes in test folder for this automation of test case.
-->I used Java as a Programming language and Maven as build Automation tool by adding necessary dependencies in pom.xml file.
-->I used real android device to test the app with the help of Vysor to connect to the laptop. I haven't used any emulators.
-->I inspected the elements using Appium Inspector.
-->I used TestNG for the assertions.
-->I organized the project by separating the methods and used testNG annotations for clean understanding.
